<p>
Earth is the third planet from the Sun and only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth' crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the for of continental landmasses within Earth's hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water Earth's groundwater, lakes, river and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and eathquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetospherecapable deflecting most of the destructive solar wind and cosmic radiation.

Earth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere,<br>particularly carbon dioxide(CO<sub>2</sub>), creates the conditions for both liquid surface and water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's light.
